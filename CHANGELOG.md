## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.0] - 2025-12-20

### Added

- VOD client stop button in Stats page: Users can now disconnect individual VOD clients from the Stats view, similar to the existing channel client disconnect functionality.
- Automated configuration backup/restore system with scheduled backups, retention policies, and async task processing - Thanks [@stlalpha](https://github.com/stlalpha) (Closes #153)
- Stream group as available hash option: Users can now select 'Group' as a hash key option in Settings → Stream Settings → M3U Hash Key, allowing streams to be differentiated by their group membership in addition to name, URL, TVG-ID, and M3U ID

### Changed

- Initial super user creation page now matches the login page design with logo, welcome message, divider, and version display for a more consistent and polished first-time setup experience
- Removed unreachable code path in m3u output - Thanks [@DawtCom](https://github.com/DawtCom)
- GitHub Actions workflows now use `docker/metadata-action` for cleaner and more maintainable OCI-compliant image label generation across all build pipelines (ci.yml, base-image.yml, release.yml). Labels are applied to both platform-specific images and multi-arch manifests with proper annotation formatting. - Thanks [@mrdynamo]https://github.com/mrdynamo) (Closes #724)
- Update docker/dev-build.sh to support private registries, multiple architectures and pushing. Now you can do things like `dev-build.sh  -p -r my.private.registry -a linux/arm64,linux/amd64` - Thanks [@jdblack](https://github.com/jblack)
- Updated dependencies: Django (5.2.4 → 5.2.9) includes CVE security patch, psycopg2-binary (2.9.10 → 2.9.11), celery (5.5.3 → 5.6.0), djangorestframework (3.16.0 → 3.16.1), requests (2.32.4 → 2.32.5), psutil (7.0.0 → 7.1.3), gevent (25.5.1 → 25.9.1), rapidfuzz (3.13.0 → 3.14.3), torch (2.7.1 → 2.9.1), sentence-transformers (5.1.0 → 5.2.0), lxml (6.0.0 → 6.0.2) (Closes #662)
- Frontend dependencies updated: Vite (6.2.0 → 7.1.7), ESLint (9.21.0 → 9.27.0), and related packages; added npm `overrides` to enforce js-yaml@^4.1.1 for transitive security fix. All 6 reported vulnerabilities resolved with `npm audit fix`.
- Floating video player now supports resizing via a drag handles, with minimum size enforcement and viewport/page boundary constraints to keep it visible.
- Redis connection settings now fully configurable via environment variables (`REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_DB`, `REDIS_URL`), replacing hardcoded `localhost:6379` values throughout the codebase. This enables use of external Redis services in production deployments. (Closes #762)
- Celery broker and result backend URLs now respect `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT`/`REDIS_DB` settings as defaults, with `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` environment variables available for override.

### Fixed

- Docker init script now validates DISPATCHARR_PORT is an integer before using it, preventing sed errors when Kubernetes sets it to a service URL like `tcp://10.98.37.10:80`. Falls back to default port 9191 when invalid (Fixes #737)
- M3U Profile form now properly resets local state for search and replace patterns after saving, preventing validation errors when adding multiple profiles in a row
- DVR series rule deletion now properly handles TVG IDs that contain slashes by encoding them in the URL path (Fixes #697)
- VOD episode processing now correctly handles duplicate episodes (same episode in multiple languages/qualities) by reusing Episode records across multiple M3UEpisodeRelation entries instead of attempting to create duplicates (Fixes #556)
- XtreamCodes series streaming endpoint now correctly handles episodes with multiple streams (different languages/qualities) by selecting the best available stream based on account priority (Fixes #569)
- XtreamCodes series info API now returns unique episodes instead of duplicate entries when multiple streams exist for the same episode (different languages/qualities)
- nginx now gracefully handles hosts without IPv6 support by automatically disabling IPv6 binding at startup (Fixes #744)
- XtreamCodes EPG API now returns correct date/time format for start/end fields and proper string types for timestamps and channel_id
- XtreamCodes EPG API now handles None values for title and description fields to prevent AttributeError
- XtreamCodes EPG `id` field now provides unique identifiers per program listing instead of always returning "0" for better client EPG handling
- XtreamCodes EPG `epg_id` field now correctly returns the EPGData record ID (representing the EPG source/channel mapping) instead of a dummy value

## [0.14.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- Sort buttons for 'Group' and 'M3U' columns in Streams table for improved stream organization and filtering - Thanks [@bobey6](https://github.com/bobey6)
- EPG source priority field for controlling which EPG source is preferred when multiple sources have matching entries for a channel (higher numbers = higher priority) (Closes #603)

### Changed

- EPG program parsing optimized for sources with many channels but only a fraction mapped. Now parses XML file once per source instead of once per channel, dramatically reducing I/O and CPU overhead. For sources with 10,000 channels and 100 mapped, this results in ~99x fewer file opens and ~100x fewer full file scans. Orphaned programs for unmapped channels are also cleaned up during refresh to prevent database bloat. Database updates are now atomic to prevent clients from seeing empty/partial EPG data during refresh.
- EPG table now displays detailed status messages including refresh progress, success messages, and last message for idle sources (matching M3U table behavior) (Closes #214)
- IPv6 access now allowed by default with all IPv6 CIDRs accepted - Thanks [@adrianmace](https://github.com/adrianmace)
- nginx.conf updated to bind to both IPv4 and IPv6 ports - Thanks [@jordandalley](https://github.com/jordandalley)
- EPG matching now respects source priority and only uses active (enabled) EPG sources (Closes #672)
- EPG form API Key field now only visible when Schedules Direct source type is selected

### Fixed

- EPG table "Updated" column now updates in real-time via WebSocket using the actual backend timestamp instead of requiring a page refresh
- Bulk channel editor confirmation dialog now displays the correct stream profile name that will be applied to the selected channels.
- uWSGI not found and 502 bad gateway on first startup

## [0.13.1] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed

## [0.13.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` file following Keep a Changelog format to document all notable changes and project history

Improves monitoring, troubleshooting, and understanding system behavior
- M3U/EPG endpoint caching: Implements intelligent caching for frequently requested M3U playlists and EPG data to reduce database load and improve response times for clients.
- Search icon to name headers for the channels and streams tables (#686)
- Comprehensive logging for user authentication events and network access restrictions

- XC client compatibility: float channel numbers now converted to integers
- M3U account and profile modals now scrollable on mobile devices for improved usability

## [0.12.0] - 2025-11-19

### Added

- RTSP stream support with automatic protocol detection when a proxy profile requires it. The proxy now forces FFmpeg for RTSP sources and properly handles RTSP URLs - Thanks [@ragchuck](https://github.com/ragchuck) (#184)
- UDP stream support, including correct handling when a proxy profile specifies a UDP source. The proxy now skips HTTP-specific headers (like `user_agent`) for non-HTTP protocols and performs manual redirect handling to improve reliability (#617)

- Login form revamped with branding, cleaner layout, loading state, "Remember Me" option, and focused sign-in flow
- Series & VOD now have copy-link buttons in modals for easier URL sharing
- `get_host_and_port` now prioritizes verified port sources and handles reverse-proxy edge cases more accurately (#618)

### Fixed

- EXTINF parsing overhauled to correctly extract attributes such as `tvg-id`, `tvg-name`, and `group-title`, even when values include quotes or commas (#637)
- Websocket payload size reduced during EPG processing to avoid UI freezes, blank screens, or memory spikes in the browser (#327)
- Logo management UI fixes including confirmation dialogs, header checkbox reset, delete button reliability, and full client refetch after cleanup
